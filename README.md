# National Park Biodiversity

## Motivation
  Wildlife preservation has always been a hot topic these days. We would like to create a web application for biologists, geo-lovers and hikers to explore both the national park and the biodiversity info in the United States so that they can have a better understanding of what to expect when planning their trips.
  
	The website allows the users to locate the parks on an interactive map which provides a summary of the parks and states. They can also look for the total numbers of distinct species grouped by categories of a selected park on the map at the macroscopic level. Moreover, by providing a filtering feature, the website is also capable of displaying relevant info of species. Users can search by any combinations they would prefer, either by state, park, or species. Furthermore, if the user is interested in acquiring deeper knowledge of the park and species, they can expect a comprehensive summary of a statistical analysis of the species population he/she is looking for on the website (i.e. density, occurrence in each state). Last but not least, we also include details about national park trails for hikers to preview, combining the biodiversity facts.
	
  In conclusion, the website serves as an relatively exhaustive user guide for nature lovers, providing useful instructions so that they can enjoy their trips while learning about birds, plants, mammals and geology.
